Nodeshot
********

Nodeshot is an open source platform for **crowdsourcing georeferenced data**.

Its goal it's to provide some robust tools to build a modern customized crowdsourcing web application quickly.

It is designed to be modular, flexible, configurable and extensible.

**This documentation is a work in progress**.

======================
Status of this project
======================

The first version of nodeshot was release in **October 2011** and was designed specifically for the community `Ninux.org`_.

.. _Ninux.org: http://ninux.org

The project evolved to become more generic, modular and reusable.
The version described in this documentation refers to the development version, which has been rewritten from scratch.

The roadmap is the following:

 * a first early release is expected for **mid February 2014**
 * a second more complete release is expected for **May 2014**

The development version is hosted at https://github.com/ninuxorg/nodeshot.

The old version in use at http://map.ninux.org/ is hosted at https://github.com/ninuxorg/nodeshot.

Once the new version will be ready it will be merged back into the original repository (ninuxorg/nodeshot).
